# Each URL may contain one of these placeholders
# {URL}  is replaced by the URL encoded representation of the wikiname
#        this is the right thing to do in most cases
# {NAME} this is replaced by the wikiname as given in the document
#        only mandatory encoded is done, urlencoding if the link
#        is an external URL, or encoding as a wikiname if it is an
#        internal link (begins with a colon)
# {SCHEME}
# {HOST}
# {PORT}
# {PATH}
# {QUERY} these placeholders will be replaced with the appropriate part
#         of the link when parsed as a URL
# If no placeholder is defined the urlencoded name is appended to the URL

# To prevent losing your added InterWiki shortcuts after an upgrade,
# you should add new ones to interwiki.local.conf
